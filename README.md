# IR-project

As part of the information retrieval course, we were given a task to build a search engine based on Wikipedia documents, the search can be performed by title,  body , or anchor text, in addition we were asked to build a main function, according to which the engine will retrieve the query search results. We built indexes for each main part of the document and wrote different retrieval methods wich we used to retrive documents

# Main Retrieval Methods
* tf-idf
* bm25
* binary search (by body,title and anchor)
* cosine similarity
* page rank
* page view

# Indexes
* body index
* anchor index
* title index

# Dictionaries
* term total
* DL
* norm_dict
* title_id_dict
